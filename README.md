# nanina
The Webapp version of Waifu Fight (the comeback)

Nanina is a website where you can get and train anime characters (waifus) through playing rhythm games!
It will provide another way of progression parallel to the tradionnal skill based progression of most rhythm game where the real only way to progress is to become better at the game.

It is right now in a barebone state with nearly none of the features of the original Waifu Fight Discord bot, but we hope this will change soon. 


## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS
 ult, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Client Project Setup

npm install
