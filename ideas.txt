Simple gameplay loop (first version):

Everything that consume energy : earn GC
GC => new waifus

Normal fights => earn waifu XP (simple statistic increase)
Constant fights => earn a bit of money and waifu XP, time down on activities

Dungeons => earn equipment
Activities
    -> cafe (money)[KAW]
    -> mining (crystals) [STR]
    -> exploration (materials) [AGI]
    -> crafting (items) [DEXT]
    -> research (bonuses) [INT]

Normal fights, dungeon, activities => user XP

Money   source  => cafe, daily login, continuous fights
        costs   => upgrade items, crafting, shop

recycle equipment
    => equipment piece (3* - 5*) (20%)
    => materials

To upgrade Items you need : (+money)
    1* => 1* crystals
    2* => 2* crystals
    3* => 3* crystals, equipment piece
    4* & 5* => crystals, materials, equipment piece

Crafting (from materials, money, (and crystals?))
    => new materials
    => permanent buffs
    => temp buffs
    => waifu upgrade materials
    => tools (more efficient activities)

Research (unlocks with user lvl)
    => new dungeons
    => new floors
    => new craftables
    => new mechanics
    => permanent buffs



Shop => extra stuff.

End game gameplay loop?

    -> very hard dungeons
        -> rewards : gc, simplifying getting other copies of a waifu, *other ressources?*
    -> leaderboards
        -> rewards : prestige?
    -> season system with pvp?
            -> rewards : gc, rare currency?


What we can add later

quests, leaderboard (should be in some form at first version), pvp
soul equipment (equipment dropped by gacha, main equipment of a waifu)


Details on how mechanics should works

Main Four ressources that are time gated :
    -> user XP, used for 
    -> Gacha Currency (or GC), used for mostly pulls
    -> Energy (or Cherish), used for normal fights and dungeons
    -> Time itself, used for activites and dungeons


GC is obtained through spending energy, daily rewards and end game dungeons. You should be able to do ~2 pull per day

In pulls, you can either obtain soul equipment or waifus (with a ratio of 10:1).
There is a limited and permanent banner. when pulling you get a currency. With enough of those, you can get the character of your choice.
Maybe a limited banner with a select waifu pool, with a limited number of pulls. when pulled, the waifu is removed from the pool. at the end you get all
the waifus in the pool.

GC shop :
                buy pulls
                waifu selection box (100% of getting the selected waifu)
                waifu duplicate
                Titles? (title I DON'T LIKE PULLING WAIFUS) (I PLAY FOR THE GAMEPLAY NOT FOR PNGS) (I CAME FOR WAIFU, STAYED FOR IMPROVEMENT) (I DONT LIKE NFTS) (PLEASE ADD MY FAVOURITE ANIME SERIES)
                Acheter un accÃ¨s aux banniÃ¨res en avant premiÃ¨re (streams en avance des autres, vidÃ©os etc) (95% evil (maybe 95% good?) never seen before in a gacha game)
                AccÃ¨s Ã  une ancienne banniÃ¨re (durÃ©e d'1 jour le temps de pull until pity un truc que tu veux)
                //Modifier les chances de proba par compte (105% evil (can't be good)) (selling accounts 20% 3* chance on black market) (i spend 3h rerolling account until i get 20% 3* chance to sell the account)



You can earn user XP when doing normal fights, dungeon and activities. this is only a constant amount only maybe modified by activity's required time.
With user XP, you can earn some bonus, some of them are max stamina (and maybe stamina regen speed.)

Spending energy : 
    When spending energy, you use a fraction of your total available energy (e.g. 20%). So for exemple if you have 80 energy left, an action will
    consume 16 energy. your rewards will be proportionnal to your energy spent plus a constant extra energy (e.g. 5). You also earn GC proportionnally
    to the energy consummed, whatever the action is. 
    The quantity regen should be proportionnal to missing energy.


Normal fights is an action where after doing a designated rhythm game map/chart, you need to spend energy to get waifu XP (proportionnal to the energy spent)
    waifu XP also depends strongly on the difficulty and the results. You also earn some user XP (constant).

Continuous fights :
    gain a little quantity of waifu XP and money, does not give user XP. It reduce activities cooldown. Since it doesn't cost stamina, you don't get gc

(Possibles changes) :
    Normal fight also reduce activities cooldown.
    You could choose between xp or reduce activities cooldown when doing a continuous fight.

Waifus : 3 equipment slots + (1/2 gadgets on future update?)
    Consumable usable only once on the same waifu which give permanent stats increase
    Star system -> from 1* to 5* (stat increase)
        Why not from 3*? Or different rarities?
    To star up, you need a duplicata or a very rare item as a substitute
    (future update : spell kit (passif + auto + spell + ult?))

    offensive stats : 
        KAW = psychic damage
        STR = physical damage
        INT = magic damage
        LUCK = useless right now, could be used for crit chance
        DEXT = critical damage
        AGI = critical chance, could be used for buff length / debuff length reduction

    activities stats : 
        KAW = maid cafÃ©/idol concert    -> money
        STR = mining minerals/crystals  -> Cristal giving permanent buffs/crafting.
        INT = research tree             -> unlock content, permanent buffs, maybe ressources
        LUCK =                          -> more of everything
        DEXT = crafting                 -> craft new gadgets, materials, items
        AGI = exploration               -> materials for crafting, upgrading waifu and items

        
        AGI DEX x2 stat weight
        Luck x4 stat weight
        max base stats for lvl 100 : 2000 (without powercreep)

Dungeons :
    Dungeons have 5 floors. Higher floors gives better equipment.
    There are multiple dungeons which gives different sets of equipments.
    When in a dungeon, your waifus fight a boss. When the boss is defeated you get waifu equipment. 
    The number is dependent on the energy spent. you also get user XP.
    your waifus do auto attack which inflict damage every X second.
    you can do a map proposed by the dungeon. at completion you get a burst of damage. 
    (from waifu's base stats, or give buffs, or activate some waifu's specific spells?. Should there be a limited amount of maps?)
    Waifu and bosses have access to buffs, debuffs, cleansing. user have access to claiming and consommables.

    To avoid players completing a very hard dungeon just by taking a lot of time, there should be a defeat mechanic?
    Time limit? Boss regeneration ? Debuffs that render waifus useless?
    (future update : blue archive like ult system?)

    obtain money :
        cafe
        continuous fights
        login rewards
        daily quests (future update)

                item for getting energy back (X time a day max) (increasing) (with gc?)
                XP boost potion (normal fight)???

                music theme??

Spent energy scale with fight drain time
Ask for energy when fighting

osu rank => average amount of time required to reach this level (difficulty rating of maps played) 
1k => 2600h (8*)        x1.5
10k => 1500h (7*)       x2
100k => 500h (6*)       x3


5 fights per day of 4m ? => 20m of game per day
average player's fight
5.5*
90% acc         => 20m of fights = 500XP
20% max combo


the next 20 minutes => 20m = 125XP

1 mois => 10h => 500*3*10 = 20 000XP (+bonus ...)

1-40 => 20kXP

dungeon, 10min?
dungeon without fighting, 8h?

user lvl 15 after one month
    10XP per fight, 150 fights => 1.5kXP

Future Updates

Achievements -> permanent and or one time rewards when completing a achievement (some based on hush-hush for exemple) like pass a ar11 od11 hp11 map.

How do we manage powercreep and fomo?

Give waifu spells

Ideas 
    Introductory/"story" dungeons?
    Rewards unique dans un story mode (questlines once per user with the last quests not being targeted at mrekk level because if you make last quest to do a 2k pp play it's gonna be hard to get)
